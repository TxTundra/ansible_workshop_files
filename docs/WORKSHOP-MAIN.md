# Ansible Workshop â€“ Ansible Basics 

Prepared by: Bryan McClellan

The content in this workshop is built in a way where the first two domains should be considered enough to get the tools in your hands to start writing and maintaining your own playbooks.

As the workshop is broken into Domains each Domain will focus on techniques and information that can be worked on either self-paced or via instructur led. The Domain are broken up in a way that should allow you to start at any Domain for the given technology or techniques covered in that particular domain. Domain0 and Domain1 are recommended learning before moving on to further Domians although that is not required.

This course assumes you have working knowledge of Linux and Windows Server Operating Systems and can work in a Linux text editor.
